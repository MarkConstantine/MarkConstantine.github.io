                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamSpeak">TeamSpeak</a> is a VoIP application that me and my friends use daily to chat and play video games together. 
                I host a dedicated teamspeak server using an Amazon AWS service called EC2. 
                To connect to this server simply download the <a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads" target="new">TeamSpeak Client</a> and connect using <b>markconstantine.tk</b> as the IP. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This web page was created for me and my friends to easily check up on who is connected to the server without having the need to connect to the server. 
                The information to the right includes each user currently connected to the server.
            </p>
